//! Drawers are wrappers around `Gui` which do rendering.
//! It is encouraged to implement custom such wrappers for applications that need their
//! own GUI look (such as games).
//!
//! The following modules provide default drawers for when you just want to get something working
//! (before starting thinking about the look). Each module supports one specific rendering backend.
//! 
//! (Currently there are none)
